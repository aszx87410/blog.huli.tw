        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Recently, the second edition of YDKJS (You Don’t Know JS) was released, called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ydkjsy">YDKJSY</a>, where Y stands for Yet. Although the second edition is not yet complete, some of the initial chapters have already been made available on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I read the first chapter, which talks about the history of JS. It mentioned an interesting issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As such, sometimes the JS engines will refuse to conform to a specification-dictated change because it would break that web content.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In these cases, often TC39 will backtrack and simply choose to conform the specification to the reality of the web. For example, TC39 planned to add a contains(..) method for Arrays, but it was found that this name conflicted with old JS frameworks still in use on some sites, so they changed the name to a non-conflicting includes(..). The same happened with a comedic&#x2F;tragic JS community crisis dubbed “smooshgate”, where the planned flatten(..) method was eventually renamed flat(..).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, it means that sometimes the JS specification must compromise with reality (existing old implementations). For example, the Array was originally supposed to add a method called contains, but it was changed to includes due to issues. Flatten was also renamed to flat.</p>
<p>There is also a term “smooshgate” that was specially marked above. When searching for this keyword, it was found that it was an event that occurred around March last year, related to the aforementioned flatten. When I saw this, my first reaction was, “Huh, why don’t I know anything?” After searching for information in Traditional Chinese, I found only this article that mentioned it: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.othree.net/log/2018/05/28/smooshgate/">SmooshGate</a> and this article that only touched on it: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@liuderchi/%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98-3-%E7%A8%AE-javascript-%E7%89%A9%E4%BB%B6%E5%B1%AC%E6%80%A7%E7%9A%84%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7-3b982f4c5695">[Note] 3 types of JavaScript object property characteristics</a>.</p>
<p>After carefully studying the origin and development of the matter, I found it to be an interesting topic, so I wrote this article to share it with everyone.</p>

        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In the past few years, “problem-solving” seems to have become a trend. When students majoring in computer science go for interviews with big companies, they are required to solve problems. Even non-computer science students are expected to solve problems during interviews. It seems that if you don’t solve problems, you will fall behind others and be eliminated by the company.</p>
<p>Actually, I have never been fond of the term “problem-solving”, mainly because of the word “solving”. I don’t know how you interpret this word, but I feel that there is a sense of “solving problems just for the sake of solving problems”, just like the tactic of solving a lot of problems. Although this tactic can be effective if used properly, I always feel that many people will end up with the mentality of “I can solve the problems I have seen, but I can’t solve the ones I haven’t seen”. If that’s the case, I don’t think it’s a good thing.</p>
<p>I have written an article before: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@hulitw/learn-coding-9c572c2fb2">What should we learn when we are learning to code?</a>, which briefly discusses this issue.</p>
<p>In short, I prefer to use the phrase “programming problem-solving” to express what I want to say, rather than the term “problem-solving”.</p>

        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>If there is one concept in JavaScript that is important and commonly used but often confused by beginners, it is undoubtedly “Asynchronous”. Compared to other concepts such as <a href="https://blog.huli.tw/2019/02/23/javascript-what-is-this/">this</a>, <a href="https://blog.huli.tw/2018/12/08/javascript-closure/">closure</a>, <a href="https://blog.huli.tw/2017/08/27/the-javascripts-prototype-chain/">prototype</a>, or <a href="https://blog.huli.tw/2018/11/10/javascript-hoisting-and-tdz/">hoisting</a>, asynchronous is used much more frequently in practical development and is often a pitfall for beginners.</p>
<p>Is asynchronous really that difficult?</p>
<p>I don’t think so. As long as you follow a correct context, you can gradually understand why asynchronous is needed and how it is handled in JavaScript.</p>
<p>I actually wrote about a similar topic four years ago, but looking back now, it was not well written. Therefore, four years later, I am revisiting this topic and hoping to write a better quality article to clarify the concept of asynchronous.</p>
<p>Before writing this article, I referred to the official documentation of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/">Node.js</a> and found that it actually explains asynchronous quite well. Therefore, this article will start with a similar approach to discuss this issue. If you don’t know Node.js, it’s okay, I will provide a brief introduction below.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, know how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, and know what ajax is before reading this article.</p>

        <p>About a year ago, I directly put my blog on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/aszx87410/blog">GitHub Issues</a>. Although few people in Taiwan do this, many Chinese developers use this method to build their blogs.</p>
<p>The reason why I chose GitHub Issues at that time was simple: convenience.</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub Issues perfectly supports Markdown syntax.</li>
<li>Uploading images is super easy.</li>
<li>When someone mentions your article using Issues, a reference will be automatically generated.</li>
<li>The comment system is super convenient.</li>
<li>You can use emojis.</li>
<li>You can watch the GitHub repo to receive notifications when it is updated.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, I chose GitHub Issues at that time.</p>
<p>However, I recently discovered a big problem that I didn’t pay attention to at the beginning, which is that the SEO of GitHub Issues is extremely poor. Even if you directly search for the title of an issue on Google, you may not be able to find it.</p>
<p>Because this problem is quite serious, I finally moved back to Hexo.</p>
<p>Actually, <a href="/2017/09/03/moving-from-logdown-to-hexo/">two years ago</a>, I had already moved my blog once, from Logdown to Hexo. But at that time, I didn’t continue to use Hexo because I thought the layout of that blog was not very good-looking.</p>
<p>And this time, the reason why I moved back was largely because I saw <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://askiebaby.github.io/">Askie Lin</a>‘s blog. When I saw it, I was amazed and thought, “Wow, this blog is also beautifully done!” Later, I found out that it was modified using the ready-made theme <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-minos">Minos</a>, so I thought I could try to switch to this theme.</p>
<p>After a whole day of adjustments today, I fixed a lot of things myself and tried to make the layout look the way I wanted it to. I found it quite smooth. Maybe it’s because the original code was written well, and there were no major problems in fixing it. I only changed the font size and the display of categories and article lists, and didn’t do much else.</p>
<p>Unless there are any unexpected circumstances, I have decided to settle down here in the future, and use GitHub as a backup place for my articles.</p>
<p>Long live Hexo, long live Minos 🎉</p>

<p>These three major frameworks are usually used to write SPA (Single Page Application). I have always believed that some basic knowledge should be possessed before learning these frameworks, especially the understanding of front-end and back-end. Otherwise, you will definitely encounter many problems that you don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>Therefore, this article uses a problem that I have encountered myself and that students often come to ask me as an example. You can also think about whether you can answer this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose I have an SPA, using a library of some routers to implement routing, so <code>/list</code> will go to the list page, and <code>/about</code> will go to the about me page.</p>
<p>But strange, when I uploaded the SPA to GitHub Pages, the homepage is good, and when I go to <code>/list</code> from the homepage, it is also good, but when I refresh <code>/list</code>, it shows 404 not found. Why is this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer this question, you must first review some basic knowledge related to front-end and back-end networks.</p>

<p>Although I have always been clear about my preferred learning methods and paths, and have turned what I think is suitable into a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Lidemy/mentor-program-3rd">course outline</a> for teaching, few people seem to look at that outline, and it does not explain the reasons behind it in detail.

</ol>
<p>The first article talks about Session and Cookie in plain language without too many technical terms. The second article directly looks at the three RFCs of Cookie to understand what Session is, and also supplements some knowledge related to Cookie. This article will delve into Session and take a look at three different Session implementation methods.</p>
<p>These three are Node.js Web framework Express, PHP, and Ruby on Rails. I chose these three because their implementation of Session mechanism is different, and I think they are suitable objects for reference.</p>

        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>A few days ago, I posted an article on Medium titled <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@hulitw/medium-analysis-40752b9efa03">Medium Chinese Writers’ Follower Ranking and Unprofessional Data Analysis</a>, in which I used Node.js to write a simple web scraper and analyzed the data.</p>
<p>Although I briefly mentioned the data source of the web scraper in the original article, I did not elaborate much on the technical aspects. In fact, I encountered some difficulties while writing the Medium web scraper. Instead of teaching everyone how to write a Medium web scraper, I think it would be more interesting to share my experience and the solutions I found to the problems I encountered while writing the web scraper.</p>
<p>Therefore, this article is intended to document my experience of writing the Medium web scraper, and also includes some tutorial elements. After reading this article, you should be able to write a similar web scraper, or at least not be confused when looking at the source code.</p>
<p>Although the web scraper I eventually wrote was related to user data, I actually started with the article list because I had a need to scrape all of my own articles.</p>
<p>The reason for this need is that the built-in functionality of Medium is actually quite poor. It is difficult to find all the articles posted by an author, or it is difficult to see them at a glance. Therefore, early articles were difficult to find except through Google.</p>
<p>So I manually created an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aszx87410.github.io/blog/medium">index of articles</a> and organized all the articles I had previously posted. But as an engineer, this is clearly something that can be done with code! So I wanted to try writing a web scraper for the article list.</p>

<p>Among the many status codes, there is one that is clearly meant to be humorous: 418 I’m a teapot.</p>
<p>But did you know that it is not part of the HTTP standard, so it is not a standard HTTP status code? You might say, “I’ve read the RFC, how can it not be?” But that RFC has nothing to do with HTTP, and many people have not noticed this.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice this at first either, and I thought 418 was part of the HTTP standard until someone posted an issue on Node.js’s GitHub in August 2017: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/14644">418 I’m A Teapot</a>.</p>
<p>The issue mentioned that they wanted to remove support for 418, and when the author of the issue was told that Go was doing the same thing, they also posted an issue on Go.</p>
<p>At the time, the request to remove the 418 status code actually caused quite a stir, and most people were actually against removing this status code. There was even a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://save418.com/">save418.com</a> created to try to save 418.</p>
<p>Recently, I spent some time studying the whole thing, and in the process of organizing it, I found that whether you are for or against it, the reasons behind it are worth thinking about, so I summarized it into an article to share with everyone.</p>
